# An Hangcow Game
 Hangcow is a word guessing game inspired by the classic Hangman game. Instead of a traditional hangman figure, in Hangcow, a cow is used as the visual element. The objective of the game is to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.

The game provides players with a set of dashes representing the letters of the hidden word. Players input letters one at a time, trying to guess the correct letters that make up the word. Each correct guess fills in the corresponding dash with the guessed letter, while each incorrect guess adds to a visual representation of the cow being hanged.

Hangcow offers players a fun and challenging way to test their vocabulary and word-guessing skills. With a variety of words to guess and a limited number of attempts allowed, players must strategize and think carefully about their letter choices to win the game.

# An Hangcow Game
 Hangcow is a word guessing game inspired by the classic Hangman game. Instead of a traditional hangman figure, in Hangcow, a cow is used as the visual element. The objective of the game is to guess the hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts.

The game provides players with a set of dashes representing the letters of the hidden word. Players input letters one at a time, trying to guess the correct letters that make up the word. Each correct guess fills in the corresponding dash with the guessed letter, while each incorrect guess adds to a visual representation of the cow being hanged.

Hangcow offers players a fun and challenging way to test their vocabulary and word-guessing skills. With a variety of words to guess and a limited number of attempts allowed, players must strategize and think carefully about their letter choices to win the game.

Hangcow is suitable for players of all ages and can be enjoyed solo or with friends and family. It's a great way to pass the time and sharpen your mind while having fun!
